      <h1>Game Instructions</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>Objective:</strong> Your task is to navigate the snake, collect
        blocks, and avoid bombs and self-collision. Each block you collect or
        shoot scores points. But be careful, as each block collected makes the
        snake grow longer, making the game increasingly challenging!
      </p>

      <h2>Controls:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Right Arrow:</strong> Turn the snake right.</li>
        <li><strong>Left Arrow:</strong> Turn the snake left.</li>
        <li><strong>Up Arrow:</strong> Turn the snake up.</li>
        <li><strong>Down Arrow:</strong> Turn the snake down.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>X key:</strong> Shoot bullets if you have any in reserve.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Game Elements:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Snake:</strong> Your character. It moves around the board and
          grows each time it collects a block.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Blocks:</strong> Collect or shoot these to score points.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bombs:</strong> Avoid these! Contact with a bomb will cost a
          life.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bullets:</strong> You can shoot these after collecting a
          certain number of blocks. Use them to remove blocks from a distance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Scoring and Snake Growth:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Shooting a block with a bullet: <strong>15 points</strong>, and the
          snake does <strong>not</strong> grow.
        </li>
        <li>
          Collecting a block by the snake: <strong>10 points</strong>, and the
          snake <strong>grows</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Game Rules:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The game ends when you lose all lives.</li>
        <li>
          Collision with the snake itself or with a bomb will result in a loss
          of life.
        </li>
        <li>After losing a life, the snake resets to its initial length.</li>
        <li>
          The game continues as long as you have at least one life remaining.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Plan your moves to avoid traps.</li>
        <li>Use bullets strategically to remove hard-to-reach blocks.</li>
      </ul>
